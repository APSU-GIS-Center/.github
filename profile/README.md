# Hello all! 

This GitHub Organization is for APSU GIS Center students and staff to collaborate and share code. 
Note that not all repositories may not be visible publicly. Contact cordellm@apsu.edu for access. Access will be granted on a case by case basis.

## To users who will be committing code, please take note of the following important bits of information.

+ In your code, make sure to NEVER commit credentials or hostnames/IPs of internal machines. They are difficult to remove from the repository.
  + Instead, the proper method is to create a configuration file with dummy information and allow end users to configure said files.
